Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce stunningly realistic and beautiful lighting effects. Essentially, it is based on an algorithm that can trace the path of light, and then simulate the way it interacts with the virtual objects it ultimately hits in the computer-generated world. It's mathematics, algorithm and a whole lot of abstraction. This project aims to introduce the basics of this algorithm, in what is probably one of the most complex and intriguing 42 projects so far.

```sh
$> git clone https://github.com/caroldaniel/42sp-cursus-minirt.git path/to/minirt
```

In your local repository, run `make`

```sh
$> make 
```

> `make` suports 5 flags:
> - `make all` or simply `make` compiles minirt in its mandatory format
> - `make clean` deletes the `.o` files generated during compilation
> - `make fclean` deletes the `.o` and the `minirt` file generated
> - `make re` executes `fclean` and `all` in sequence, recompiling the program
